# Hi there, I'm Mohammad üëã  

## üöÄ About Me  
As a data analyst, I am passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive better decision-making. I am constantly developing my skills and have completed various courses to strengthen my expertise in the field. 
My dedication and perseverance led me to work as a freelance data analyst, where I gained valuable experience working with real-world datasets. Freelancing has helped me discover my strengths, especially my ability to meet deadlines, adapt quickly, and learn new tools or techniques when needed. I successfully picked up new skills mid-way in several projects and applied them effectively to deliver meaningful results.

As a freelance data analyst, I developed expertise in **data analysis** using **Python**. I am proficient in the end-to-end data analysis process, including:  
- Asking the right questions.  
- Data wrangling and cleaning.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Drawing conclusions and communicating results effectively.

## üìä Key Projects
### 1. **Addressing HR Workforce Challenges**  
- **Objective**: In this project, we analyzed HR data to help the company reduce the resignation rate by effectively managing HR to enhance productivity and employee satisfaction.

- **Key Insight**: Out of 300 employees in the company, 33% are active, 33% are on leave, and 34% have resigned. The overall employee shortage rate is 60%. Projects with a higher employee shortage rate have a heavier workload and, consequently, a higher resignation rate.

- **Skills Used**:  
  - Power BI (Power Query, DAX)
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - What-if Scenario
  - Dashboard Design
  - Data Modeling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Visualization and Reporting
  - Data Storytelling

### 2. **Supply Chain Analysis in Power BI**  
- **Objective**: In this project, we will analyze supply chain data to optimize shipping operations and enhance the customer delivery experience. Our analysis will focus on shipping performance and timeliness, customer delivery behavior across regions, and the relationship between sales performance and shipping efficiency.
- **Key Insight**: 54.78% of orders were delivered late. Furthermore, we investigated whether late deliveries result in low profit, but found no patterns to support that. On the contrary, countries with a high or moderate percentage of late orders often generate high profit, likely due to the high volume of orders delivered to those regions.
- **Skills Used**:  
  - Power BI (Power Query, DAX)
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Dashboard Design
  - Data Modeling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Visualization and Reporting
  - Data Storytelling
- **Project Link**: [View the Project](https://github.com/MohammadGhanaym/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Supply%20Chain%20Analysis%20in%20Power%20BI)

### 3. **Supermarket Sales Analysis in Python**  
- **Objective**: Analyzed branch performance, revenue trends, product line ratings per branch, and the impact of customer type on revenue.
- **Key Insight**: The Naypyitaw branch shows slightly higher revenue than the other branches. However, the overlapping confidence intervals suggest that this difference may not be statistically significant, meaning we cannot confidently generalize this trend beyond the observed data. 
- **Skills Used**:  
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
  - Descriptive Statistics  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Data Visualization and Reporting
  - Data Storytelling
- **Project Link**: [View the Project](https://github.com/MohammadGhanaym/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Supermarket%20Sales%20Analysis%20in%20Python)

### 4. **Customer Personality Analysis**  
- **Objective**: In this project, I analyzed the characteristics of a sample of IFood customers who accepted the last campaign offer. I helped them identify customers who are more likely to accept an offer, enabling them to make personalized campaigns to target the right customers and save money.
- **Key Insight:** The higher the customer's education level, the more likely they are to accept an offer.
- **Skills Used**:  
  - Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, DAX, Data Cleaning).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
  - Data Visualization and Reporting.
